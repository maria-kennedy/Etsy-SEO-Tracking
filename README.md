# Etsy-SEO-Tracking
An automated dashboard to track weekly Etsy SEO performance 

A tool that helps improve SEO strategy by identifying high-traffic keywords and 
optimizing product listings accordingly.

It should: 
Utilize the Google Analytics API to pull real-time SEO data, 
including keyword performance, traffic sources, and user behavior.
Process data using Python and visualize key metrics with matplotlib and Plotly.
Automate weekly reports and sent performance summaries via email using Pythonâ€™s smtplib.

Due to the recent switch from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics in July 2024,
I'm still working out a few kinks with the weekly email.

Please note that some parts of the code such as API keys are hidden to protect myself
as well as my loyal customers' personal information. This is simply a personal project 
I've been working on in my free time in order to get some real world coding expperience.
